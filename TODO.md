  ## ðŸ§ª Testing & Validation

- [ ] Create a test script to validate script headers (shebang, category, description)
  Ensures consistency and supports cheatsheet generation.

- [ ] Set up a Git pre-commit hook to run header validation before every commit  
  Blocks commits if required fields are missing.

- [ ] Create a dedicated `tests/` directory for all validation scripts  
  Helps keep the codebase organized and scalable.

- [ ] Add a "test" label to all test-related GitHub issues for better filtering  
  Visual separation of validation and utility tasks.

- [ ] Add a future `test_all.sh` or `Makefile` to run all validation and sync tests together  
  Supports automation and continuous validation.
